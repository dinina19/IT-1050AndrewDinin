}// a.) The Main(string[] args) is the entry point to the application.
 // b.) The difference between an integer varible and a floating point variable is that integers do not store decimal places while
 //  floating-point/ double do.
 // c.) An example of a method in chapter 4 is static.void Main()
 // d.)	Like we have types double and int, we can create our own custom types using Classes.
 //  Each class has variables called instance variables or class members.  To read the value of an instance variable, we create method called a get accessor.
 //  To assign a value ton instance variable, we use a method called a set accessor.
 // e.) The difference between a class and an object is that classes are like templates and help define objects and the objects are names that hold and store data.
 // you can only create a class once, however an infinite amount of objects ca
