# Question 2 Answer
  the if and while statements are similar to one another as they allow you to control the flow of your code based on inputs. this allows you to repeat or skip over entire sections of your code that arent needed, such as telling someone they are speeding when they arent, or allowing a section to repeat, like the tick up counters

    the statements are also different from one another as an if statement can not cause a statement to be repeated on its own, since it is only a conditional statement and not a loop. the While loop, on the other hand, can act as a conditional statement by having multiple while loops within one another to filter.
